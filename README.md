Note: installation is based on OS X.

    Install (if you don't have them):
        Node.js: brew install node
        Brunch: npm install -g brunch
        Run npm install to install all packages
    Run:
        brunch w --server — watches the project with continuous rebuild. This will also launch HTTP server with pushState.
